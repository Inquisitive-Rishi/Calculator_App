# Calculator_App

This is my 3rd JS project.

-- Functionalities --

Current iteration:

- All the basic calculator functions.
- A backspace button to erase last entered number.
- A clear button to erase all operations to start afresh.
- This version does not includes BODMAS rule i.e one operation at a time.
  i.e 12 + 7 - 5 * 3 gives 42 and not 4.
- Dividing by 0 gives error.

Future iteration:
- will include BODMAS rule and you can chain multiple operations.
- Keyboard support

Note: Result has been capped to 15 digits to prevent screen overflow.
